# Description
The most recent final mortality data collected by the CDC for 2017 shows that heart disease and stroke are 1st and 5th leading causes of death in Americans. Plaque buildup in arteries and excessive clotting can result in both heart disease and stroke when left untreated. It is estimated that over 6 million Americans are on anticoagulation therapies. These treatments involve a great deal of monitoring especially, in patients taking warfarin.  Patients on warfarin need frequent monitoring of their INR levels, this could happen as often as every 2-3 days. 

The project idea is to develop an anticoagulation monitoring software that can be downloaded as an application by patients and their healthcare providers. This software will help facilitate communication between providers and their patient.
